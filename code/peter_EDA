+ Members for less than a year tend to use Visualize and Report less than other groups
+ Members for 1-3 years are the highest users of Alert
+ In general, Report usage increases as a customer is a member for longer

+ Can make this into a graph if we want to use it

+ If a customer uses either visualize, alert, or report, they are __% more likely to use another of the three
